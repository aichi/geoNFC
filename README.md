Windows Phone 8 App

GeoNFC is a Near Field Communication tag reader and writer app for you windows phone 8, aimed to create geo tags in standard format. It can parse ndef formatted messages to human readable form. What is the different to other nfc apps? It is specialized to geo topics. The developer has bothered it that there was no app to pick coordinates form a map and write it to tags. Previously, the user was requested to type the location manually. Typically coordinates are unknown. Now write your favorite locations easily on tags chosen from a map.
